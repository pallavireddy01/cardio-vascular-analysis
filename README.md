# 🫀 Cardiovascular Disease Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to analyze cardiovascular disease data and build a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases based on patient health metrics. It serves as a helpful tool for medical professionals and researchers to support early diagnosis and awareness.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Understand and visualize key features contributing to cardiovascular health.
- Clean and preprocess real-world medical data.
- Train and evaluate machine learning models for disease prediction.
- Achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall for medical relevance.
- Deploy a model ready for real-world integration in healthcare applications.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab**
- (Optional) **Streamlit** for UI or **Flask** for API deployment

## 🗂️ Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Cardiovascular Disease dataset ]
- Features: Age, Gender, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Glucose Level, Smoking, Alcohol, Physical Activity, etc.
- Target: Presence (1) or absence (0) of cardiovascular disease.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Correlation matrix for identifying strong features.
- Histograms and KDE plots for feature distribution.
- Box plots to detect outliers.
- Heatmaps and count plots for data insight.

## 🧪 Model Building
